                <p>The Netflix original series GLOW has one of the more original premises in recent TV history: 
                    It chronicles the life of a fledgling professional wrestling promotion called the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling, 
                    as various aspiring actresses and generally women down on their luck audition and agree to take a stab at a wholly new field.</p>

                <p>What sets Parks and Recreation apart from other comedies is that it’s absolutely sincere and free of cynicism. 
                    It’s clear that even if the characters rib each other, there’s genuine love between them. But yes, the show is hilarious, 
                    and Amy Poehler’s Leslie Knope is one of the seminal sitcom characters of our time.</p>

                <p>The 80s-set mystery thriller is equal parts It, Stand by Me, 
                    and The Goonies as it mashes up the creepy atmosphere of a Stephen King novel with compelling characters and a strong narrative drive. 
                    The true test of Stranger Things is whether the show works without the nostalgia-inducing 80s setting, and the answer is yes.</p>

                    (and improving on) Anakin Skywalker’s backstory before he took on the persona of Darth Vader.</p>
